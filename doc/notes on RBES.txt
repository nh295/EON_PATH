- i need to understand how BIOMASS by itself achieves required spatial resolution 
 or maybe it doesn't but it's better to develop this instrument for improved accuracy than it is to develop
 the L-band radar

==> OK BIOMASS is a SAR and has a spatial resolution of 3km according to the model. Need to check whether this is 
realistic, and BIOMASS would just be a P-band version of SMAP's SAR, which would increase the penetration 
without decreasing the spatial resolution. 

==> It seems that P-band SAR would not be great to measure soil moisture. 

- we could explain it in this way" nominal case no BIOMASS> now what would be the value of developing
a P-band soil moisture mission?

- why are 2 sat architectures not necessary for max science?
- why is score different from RBES_explain_score and res.score for best arch with uniform weights? 
    * the actual score is computed using variables that come from defuzzyfy intervals
	* the RBES_explain_score comes from the satisfacton of the value fact whih comes from aggregation rules
	
	the variables are also potentially modified by old synergy rules so I switched those off. ==> OK, solved 
	it and both problems at the same itme.
	

1) do we need to add objectives concerning biomass ==> OK
2) rerun case where BIOMASS can measure soil moisture, equal weights.
2b) run case with 100% ecosystems and see if best architectures change (not expected)
3) run case where BIOMASS does a poor job at measuring soil moisture with equal weights, now don't want BIOMASS
3b) run case with 100% ecosystems, now BIOMASS is back
4) creae local search around current SMAP architecture, what is best addendum, what is best descoping option
5) create plot for BIOMASS power a fuzzy interval, impact on cost of single-sat mission

- could see what is the value of the weight ratio that makes this new architecture better than the previous one?
